      <p>My name is Peng Lei. The character "Peng" in Chinese is the name of one legendary bird in Chinese mythology. Peng has been recorded in many ancient legends. Nowdays, it mostly associates with Buddhist culture. The image of Peng mixed with the legendary bird creature Garuda from Buddhist mythology when the religion was introduced into China. </p>

      <p>I studied History in University of Toronto. Why do people need to study history? For me, history could provide me a different angle to view the world.</p>
      
      <p>Wuthering Heights is my favorite novel from all time. When I read the book as a child, I was impressed by the plot. When I reviewed the book later in my life, I found out that there is more to the book. My study in history allows me to dig more from the historical background of the time and how this story reflects on the society at the time.</p>
